Problem Overview 
-------------------
Where will a new guest book their first travel experience?


Instead of waking to overlooked "Do not disturb" signs, Airbnb travelers find themselves rising with the birds in a whimsical treehouse, 
having their morning coffee on the deck of a houseboat, or cooking a shared regional breakfast with their hosts.New users on Airbnb can 
book a place to stay in 34,000+ cities across 190+ countries. By accurately predicting where a new user will book their first travel 
experience, Airbnb can share more personalized content with their community, decrease the average time to first booking, and better forecast demand.
Airbnb challenges you to predict in which country a new user will make his or her first booking.

In this problem, you are given a list of users along with their demographics, web session records, and some summary statistics. 
You are asked to predict which country a new user's first booking destination will be. All the users in this dataset are from the USA.
There are 12 possible outcomes of the destination country: 'US', 'FR', 'CA', 'GB', 'ES', 'IT', 'PT', 'NL','DE', 'AU', 'NDF' 
(no destination found), and 'other'. Please note that 'NDF' is different from 'other' because 'other' means there was a booking, 
but is to a country not included in the list, while 'NDF' means there wasn't a booking.
